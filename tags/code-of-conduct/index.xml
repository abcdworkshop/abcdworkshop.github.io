      <description>The ABCD Workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers.</description>
